**Inspiration:**

    Saw a lot of similar MacroPads so i made one myself. Planning to make a better new one after I test this one.

**Challenges**

    The biggest challenge was making the Case for it in Fusion 360, but I am satisfied about the result. Routing the PCB routes was pretty easy after I understood the logic, it was pretty fun.

**Seeed XIAO RP2040:**

BOM:

    6x Cherry MX switches
    6x blank DSA keycaps
    1x Seeed XIAO RP2040 (THT)
    1x PCB
    4x M3 x 7mm screws

    Others:
    KMK firmware
    Top and Bottom step file of Case.
